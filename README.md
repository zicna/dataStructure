# Data Structures
___
 ## Description 

This repository will be used as a place where I will practice newly learned data structures.

___
### Node-based data structure
**Node** pieces of data that may be dispersed throughout the computer's memory. Node-based data structures offer new way to organize and access data that provide a number of major performance advantages.
#### Linked List
Command to run this file: 
`ruby linked_list.rb`

- we can only move forward through the list
___

#### Doubly Linked List
Command to run this file: 
`ruby doubly_linked_list.rb`

- one variant of linked list
- each node keeps track of *next node* (as linked list does) but also *previous node*.
- keeps track of *first node* (as linked list) but also *last node*
- we can move both forward and backward through the list 
- insert data on either side at O(1)
- delete data on either side at O(1)
- perfect data structure for **queue**
